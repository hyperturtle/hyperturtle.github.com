                                    <strong>Important Information About Procedures for Registering Cards</strong>: To
                                    help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money-laundering activities,
                                    federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information
                                    that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When
                                    you register your Card, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, social
                                    security number and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may
                                    also ask to see copies of your driver's license or other identifying documents.
                                    We also will request information of any Registered User, including, but not limited
                                    to, the full name and date of birth of any Registered User.

                                    registered and we have successfully verified your personal information, we will
                                    issue and mail a Personalized Card to you. When you receive your Personalized Card,
                                    you will need to activate it and choose a Personal Identification Number ("PIN")
                                    online or by phone at the website address or the number on the sticker on the Personalized
                                    Card. Once you activate your Personalized Card, the amount remaining on the Temporary

                                    we may limit the amount, number or type of transactions you can make on your Card
                                    and any funding or reload of your Card. You agree that you will: (i) not use the

                                    you will need to provide your employer or payor with the direct deposit enrollment
                                    form that is included with your Personalized Card. You may also print an enrollment

                                    <strong>Authorization Holds</strong>. When you use your Card to pay for goods or
                                    services, certain merchants may ask us to authorize the transaction in advance and
                                    may estimate its final value. When you use your Card at an ATM or for a teller cash
                                    advance transaction, we generally authorize the transaction in advance (including
                                    all applicable fees). When we authorize the transaction, we commit to make the requested
                                    funds available when the transaction finally settles and will place a temporary
                                    hold on your Card's funds for the amount indicated by the merchant. We also may
                                    add an amount for certain merchants to ensure that sufficient funds will be available
                                    to cover the final transaction. Transactions at certain merchants that authorize
                                    high dollar amounts, especially rental car companies and hotels, may cause an "authorization"
                                    or a "hold" on your available balance for up to 90 days. Until the transaction finally
                                    settles, the funds subject to the hold will not be available to you for other purposes.
                                    We will only charge your Card for the correct amount of the final transaction, however,
                                    and we will release any excess amount when the transaction finally settles.

                                    <strong>Your Obligation for Overdrafts</strong>. You should maintain sufficient
                                    value on your Card to pay for each transaction. You are not authorized to make purchases
                                    that in the aggregate exceed $2,500 per calendar day. If a merchant attempts to
                                    process a transaction for more than the value available on the Card, the transaction
                                    may be declined. If you conduct transactions in an amount that exceeds the value
                                    on your Card, you agree to pay us the overdrawn amount immediately, without further
                                    demand. We may deduct the overdraft amount from any current or future funds on this
                                    or any other Card you register, activate or maintain (including any other prepaid

                                    <strong>Card Expiration; Life of Card</strong>. Subject to applicable law, you may

                                    at least one year from the date of first activation and will be subject to a monthly
                                    maintenance fee for the life of the Card. If your Card has a zero or negative balance,
                                    we may, at our option, cancel your Card without notice. Once the Card has expired

                                    <strong>Foreign Transactions</strong>. If you conduct a transaction in a currency

                                    the transaction may convert any related debit or credit into U.S. dollars in accordance
                                    with its then current policies. MasterCard and Visa currently use a conversion rate
                                    that is either: (a) selected from a range of rates available in the wholesale currency
                                    markets (note: this rate may be different from the rate the association itself receives),
                                    or (b) the government-mandated rate. The conversion rate may be different from the
                                    rate in effect on the date of your transaction and the date it is posted to your
                                    account. We will impose a charge equal to 3% of the transaction amount (including
                                    credits and reversals) for each transaction (U.S. or foreign currency) that you

                                    <strong>Recurring Transactions</strong>. Your Temporary Card may not be used for
                                    recurring transactions. If you intend to use the Personalized Card for recurring
                                    transactions, you should monitor your balance and keep funds loaded to the Card
                                    to cover the transactions. "Recurring transactions" are transactions that are automatically
                                    charged to your Card each month with or without any action on your part. Examples
                                    of merchants that may use recurring transactions include wireless carriers, Internet
                                    service providers, health clubs, insurance companies that automatically charge monthly
                                    premiums to the Card and cable TV services. Because the Card is prepaid and does
                                    not carry a credit line, these merchants may suspend or cancel your service if you
                                    don't have enough value left on the Card when that recurring transaction comes due.
                                    This could be important if the recurring charge is for an essential service. We
                                    are not responsible if a recurring transaction is declined because you have not
                                    maintained a sufficient balance on your Card to cover the transaction.

                                    <strong>Change in Terms</strong>. Subject to the limitations of applicable law,
                                    we may at any time add to, delete or change the terms of this Agreement by sending
                                    you a notice (unless otherwise stated herein that no notice shall be required).
                                    Advance notice may not be given, however, if we need to make the change immediately
                                    in order to maintain or restore the security of the Card or any related payment
                                    system. If any such change becomes permanent and disclosure to you of the change
                                    would not jeopardize the security of the Card or any related payment system, we
                                    will provide notice to you within 30 days from the making of the change.
